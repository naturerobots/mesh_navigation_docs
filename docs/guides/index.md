# Guides

We provide a collection of guides for both developers and applied users. Readers should have a basic understanding of what MeshNav is; if you are a complete beginner, we recommend starting with the [tutorials](/tutorials/index.md) instead. This section aims to include:

* Applying MeshNav on your own robots: tell us about your platform, show your environment, and present your goals using MeshNav as the solution.
* Structured overviews of working meshing pipelines with real robots.
* Explanations and examples showing how to use MeshNav interfaces in your own code.
* Any documentation that does not fit into either the “[library](/library/index.md)” or the “[tutorials](/tutorials/index.md)” categories.

Guides may be written in a blog-like style. Do not forget to document what you did to make MeshNav work and open a PR with your new guide. This can help newcomers get things running much faster.

# Mesh Planner and Controller

In classic mobile robot navigation, we like to distinguish between global path planning and local motion planning to balance long-term goals with real-time feasibility.
The global planner provides a high-level route through the environment, ensuring the robot moves efficiently toward its destination.
The local planner, in turn, adapts this route to the robotâ€™s immediate surroundings and dynamics, handling obstacles and uncertainties as they appear.
Importantly, this concept remains the same regardless of the underlying representation: whether navigation is performed on a 2D grid map or in a 3D mesh-based environment.

## Global Planners

Mesh navigation implements a bunch of planners

### Dijkstra Planner


### CVP

The continuous vector field planner (short CVP), is

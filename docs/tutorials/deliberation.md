# Deliberation

This guide provides tutorials explaining how to integrate mesh navigation into well-known deliberation approaches such as behavior trees and similar frameworks, as listed in [awesome-ros-deliberation](https://github.com/ros-wg-delib/awesome-ros-deliberation).

## MBF Deliberation == MeshNav Deliberation

MeshNav uses the standardized, map-agnostic interfaces of [Move Base Flex (MBF)](https://github.com/naturerobots/move_base_flex).
Therefore, the standard path-planning and control actions in MeshNav can be integrated just like any other MBF implementation or plugin.
We have collected simple examples for different deliberation mechanisms here: [https://github.com/amock/mbf_deliberation](https://github.com/amock/mbf_deliberation).

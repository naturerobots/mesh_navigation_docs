# MeshNav Tutorial Worlds

For the tutorials we created a selection of virtual worlds, which we categorized in realistic and simplistic environments.
Realistic worlds bring us closer to real-world conditions by modeling complex geometry, textures, and dynamics, which helps evaluate how algorithms perform in practice.
Simplistic worlds, on the other hand, keep environments minimal so that examples can run even on low-end hardware and interesting situations can be studied in isolation without unnecessary complexity.
This separation ensures both robustness testing under realistic conditions and efficient, focused experimentation when needed.
